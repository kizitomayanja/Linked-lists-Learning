# Linked-lists-Learning
I created this repository to store all the finished code during the time that I will be learning anything to deal with linked lists and hash tables or anything else that I find to carry the same concept later on in the future. As of right now, all I know about the topics is what I have so far uploaded. For now, it is only in C although I hope to learn more about them later on in other programming languages like Java, Python and C++. For now, let's stick to C. I plan to learn Java next, however, the next time I use something remotely close to linked lists in Java won't be in a while.
